Economists calculate SCC by assigning a monetary value to all of the harms that are predicted to arise in the future from emitting 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide.<br>The calculation here assumes $0.50 / tonne CO2 which roughly corresponds to the DICE (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICE_model">Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy</a>) model for the year 2050.`,
