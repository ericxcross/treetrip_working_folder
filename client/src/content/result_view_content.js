A tree can absorb as much as 22kg of carbon dioxide over the course of one year. Trees release the <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/planet-earth/how-many-trees-does-it-take-to-produce-oxygen-for-one-person/">oxygen we breath</a> using sunlight, carbon dioxide and water. Trees also have many other environment benefits such as providing an energy absorbent blanket across the land. The evaporation from a single tree can produce the cooling effect of 10 room size air conditioners operating 20 hours a day.`,

Economists calculate SCC by assigning a monetary value to all of the harms that are predicted to arise in the future from emitting 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide.<br><br>The calculation here assumes $0.50 / tonne CO2 which roughly corresponds to the DICE (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICE_model">Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy</a>) model for 2050.`,
